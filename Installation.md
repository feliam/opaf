# Windows installation #
First you need **python** and the **setuptools** installed. Download and run this two:

  * http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi
  * http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe#md5=57e1e64f6b7c7f1d2eddfc9746bbaf20

Now you only need to easy\_install the Open PDF Analysis Framework like this..

c:\Python2.7\python.exe c:\Python2.7\Scripts\easy\_install.exe opaf

.. and that's it. Here I've compiled a video that show how easy it is to easy\_install it -> http://bit.ly/feJQf9


# OSX/Linux installation #
Asumming you have python 2.x and setuptools installed you need to run:

` $easy_install opaf `
